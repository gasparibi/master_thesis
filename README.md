# README

This repository demonstrates an R implementation of standard SAS-based relative bioavailability analyses for Phase 1 clinical trials. 

An end-to-end example is provided for a crossover design using simulated data. 
Analysis scripts use the RDS file to preserve factor structure and numeric precision; a CSV copy is provided for inspection.

Fixed-sequence and parallel-group designs are implemented at the code level without illustrative datasets.
